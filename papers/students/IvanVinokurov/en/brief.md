# Purpose
The purpose of this thesis is to study and subsequently implement cryptographic algorithms for data encryption and their implementation in the form of components. The developed components are used to create digital certificates and digital signatures of executable files. 
# Implementation
The cryptography components were implemented in accordance with the relevant specifications. The final product is a console application that allows BER encoding of PKCS#1, #5, and #7 cryptography standard fields.
# Future plans
In the future, I plan to complete the implementation of the remaining PKCS components (up to and including 15). The implementation of the decode function in the Eco.ASNOne.BER1 component will be completed. In addition, it is also necessary to complete the implementation of the digital signature utility.
